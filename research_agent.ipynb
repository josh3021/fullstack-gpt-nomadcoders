The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution through OpenSSH on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\\nWhile xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nMicrosoft employee and PostgreSQL developer Andres Freund reported the backdoor after investigating a performance regression in Debian Sid. Freund noticed that SSH connections were generating an unexpectedly high amount of CPU usage as well as causing errors in Valgrind, a memory debugging tool. Freund reported his finding to Openwall Project\\'s open source security mailing list, which brought it to the attention of various software vendors. The attacker made efforts to obfuscate the code, as the backdoor consists of multiple stages that act together. \\nOnce the compromised version is incorporated into the operating system, it alters the behavior of OpenSSH\\'s SSH server daemon by abusing the systemd library, allowing the attacker to gain administrator access. According to the analysis by Red Hat, the backdoor can \"enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely\".\\nA subsequent investigation found that the campaign to insert the backdoor into the XZ Utils project was a culmination of approximately three years of effort, between November 2021 and February 2024, by a user going by the name Jia Tan and the nickname JiaT75 to gain access to a position of trust within the project. After a period of pressure on the founder and head maintainer to hand over the control of the project via apparent sock puppetry, Jia Tan gained the position of co-maintainer of XZ Utils and was able to sign off on version 5.6.0, which introduced the backdoor, and version 5.6.1, which patched some anomalous behavior that could have been apparent during software testing of the operating system. \\nSome of the suspected sock puppetry pseudonyms include accounts with usernames like Jigar Kumar, krygorin4545, and misoeater91. It is suspected that the names Jia Tan, as well as the supposed code author Hans Jansen (for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1), are pseudonyms chosen by the participants of the campaign. Neither have any sort of visible public presence in software development beyond the short few years of the campaign. \\nThe backdoor was notable for its level of sophistication and for the fact that the perpetrator practiced a high level of operational security for a long period of time while working to attain a position of trust. American security researcher Dave Aitel has suggested that it fits the pattern attributable to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor believed to be working on behalf of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Journalist Thomas Claburn suggested that it could be any state actor or a non-state actor with considerable resources.\\n\\n\\n== Mechanism ==\\nThe malicious code is known to be in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. The exploit remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely. The malicious mechanism consists of two compressed test files that contain the malicious binary code. These files are available in the g\\n\\nXZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov\\'s LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\nXZ Utils can compress and decompress the xz and lzma file formats. Since the LZMA format has been considered legacy,\\nXZ Utils by default compresses to xz. In addition, decompression of the .lz format used by lzip is supported since version 5.3.4.\\nIn most cases, xz achieves higher compression rates than alternatives like zip, gzip and bzip2. Decompression speed is higher than bzip2, but lower than gzip. Compression can be much slower than gzip, and is slower than bzip2 for high levels of compression, and is most useful when a compressed file will be used many times.\\nXZ Utils consists of two major components:\\n\\nxz, the command-line compressor and decompressor (analogous to gzip)\\nliblzma, a software library with an API similar to zlib\\nVarious command shortcuts exist, such as lzma (for xz --format=lzma), unxz (for xz --decompress; analogous to gunzip) and xzcat (for unxz --stdout; analogous to zcat).\\n\\n\\n== Usage ==\\nBoth the behavior of the software and the properties of the file format have been designed to work similarly to those of the popular Unix compressing tools gzip and bzip2.\\nJust like gzip and bzip, xz and lzma can only compress single files (or data streams) as input. They cannot bundle multiple files into a single archive –  to do this an archiving program is used first, such as tar.\\nCompressing an archive:\\n\\nDecompressing the archive:\\n\\nVersion 1.22 or greater of the GNU implementation of tar has transparent support for tarballs compressed with lzma and xz, using the switches --xz or -J for xz compression, and --lzma for LZMA compression.\\nCreating an archive and compressing it:\\n\\nDecompressing the archive and extracting its contents:\\n\\nSingle-letter tar example for archive with compress and decompress with extract using short suffix:\\n\\nxz has supported multi-threaded compression (with the -T flag) since 2014, version 5.2.0; since version 5.4.0 threaded decompression has been implemented. Threaded decompression requires multiple compressed blocks within a stream which are created by the threaded compression interface. The number of threads can be less than defined if the file is not big enough for threading with the given settings or if using more threads would exceed the memory usage limit.\\n\\n\\n== File format ==\\n\\nAn xz file is a sequence of one or more streams. There may be null bytes (padding) after each stream.\\nThe xz format improves on lzma by allowing for preprocessing filters (BCJ and delta). The exact filters used are similar to those used in 7z, as 7z\\'s filters are available in the public domain via the LZMA SDK. xz\\'s RISC-V BCJ filter is its own addition.\\nThe author of lzip claims that the xz format is inadequate for long-term archiving.\\nAll multi-byte values are encoded in little-endian.\\n\\n\\n=== Stream structure ===\\n\\n\\n=== Block structure ===\\n\\n\\n== Development and adoption ==\\nDevelopment of XZ Utils took place within the Tukaani Project, a small group of developers who once maintained a Linux distribution based on Slackware. The chosen name \"XZ\" is not an abbreviation but instead appears to be a random given name for the data compressors, as there is no mention anywhere in the official specification on the meaning of \"XZ\".\\nThe .xz file format specification version 1.0.0 was officially released in January 2009.\\nAll of the source code for xz and liblzma has been released into the public domain.

      "### What is the XZ Backdoor?\n",
      "\n",
      "The XZ backdoor was inserted by an individual using the pseudonym **Jia Tan**. It allows an attacker who possesses a specific **Ed448 private key** to execute remote code on affected Linux systems via **OpenSSH**. The vulnerability has been assigned a **CVSS score of 10.0**, indicating a critical severity level.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How Does It Work?\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Insertion Method**: The backdoor was introduced after Jia Tan gained a position of trust within the XZ Utils project, which took approximately three years. This involved creating multiple pseudonymous accounts to exert pressure on the project's maintainers and ultimately allowing Tan to sign off on the compromised versions of the software.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Malicious Mechanism**: The backdoor remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. When triggered, it alters the behavior of the OpenSSH SSH server daemon by exploiting the **systemd** library, enabling unauthorized remote access to the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Obfuscation**: The malicious code was designed with multiple stages to obfuscate its true purpose, making it harder to detect during routine software testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Discovery**: The backdoor was discovered by **Andres Freund**, a Microsoft employee and PostgreSQL developer, who noticed unusual CPU usage and errors in memory debugging tools while investigating performance issues in Debian Sid.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Widespread Risk**: At the time of discovery, the backdoored versions had not been widely deployed in production systems but were present in development versions of major Linux distributions. This raised concerns about the potential for widespread exploitation if the backdoor had been integrated into production environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Supply Chain Security Concerns**: The incident highlighted vulnerabilities in the open-source software supply chain, emphasizing the need for better security practices and oversight in the development and maintenance of open-source projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**: The sophistication of the backdoor and the operational security practiced by the perpetrator led some experts to suggest that it may be linked to advanced persistent threat actors, potentially state-sponsored.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The XZ backdoor incident serves as a critical reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in open-source software development and the importance of maintaining rigorous security practices. It underscores the need for vigilance in monitoring software supply chains and ensuring that contributors to open-source projects are trustworthy. The incident has prompted discussions about improving security measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\u001b[0m\n",
