      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "- 400g (14 oz) spaghetti or your preferred pasta\n",
      "- 150g (5 oz) guanciale (or pancetta if guanciale isn't available), diced\n",
      "- 3 large eggs\n",
      "- 1 large egg yolk\n",
      "- 100g (3.5 oz) Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated\n",
      "- Freshly ground black pepper\n",
      "- Salt (for pasta water)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cook the Pasta:**\n",
      "   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\n",
      "   - Add the pasta and cook until al dente according to package instructions.\n",
      "   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare the Sauce:**\n",
      "   - In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolk, grated Pecorino Romano, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper until well combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cook the Guanciale:**\n",
      "   - While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat.\n",
      "   - Add the diced guanciale and cook until crispy and golden, about 4-5 minutes.\n",
      "   - Remove from heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Combine Pasta and Guanciale:**\n",
      "   - Add the drained hot pasta to the skillet with guanciale (off the heat to prevent scrambling the eggs).\n",
      "   - Toss to coat the pasta in the rendered fat.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Create the Carbonara Sauce:**\n",
      "   - Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta.\n",
      "   - Toss vigorously to combine, adding reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach a creamy, silky sauce that coats the pasta evenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Serve:**\n",
      "   - Serve immediately with extra Pecorino Romano and black pepper on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips:**\n",
      "- The key to a good Carbonara is to mix the eggs quickly with hot pasta to create a creamy sauce without scrambling.\n",
      "- Use high-quality ingredients for the best flavor.\n",
